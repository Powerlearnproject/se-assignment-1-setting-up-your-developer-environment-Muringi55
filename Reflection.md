This is a document that outlines or the different challenges I faced when doing the assignment and how I resolved them.
I faced a problem when trying to send my local repository into my remote repository of the sample project.
A little research on google helped me solve the problem.  I should use 
     git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/dev-setup-documentation.git 
to do the task.
I also found out that creating a .gitignore file is recommended if you have files that you intend on not tracking.
